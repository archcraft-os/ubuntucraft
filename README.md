## Overview

- Turns your Ubuntu into **Archcraft**
- Fully configured `openbox` window manager
- Fully configured `bspwm` window manager
- Multiple **themes/styles** for both WMs
- Everything else that Archcraft offers

> `Ubuntucraft` is not an ISO or Ubuntu based distribution.

**Ubuntucraft** is an installable package that will turn your Ubuntu installation into Archcraft. Once installed on the top of Ubuntu, It'll offer everything Archcraft offers on your Ubuntu.

**`Important`** : Ubuntucraft is created on the top of `Ubuntu 22.04 LTS Desktop` and It's ***recommended*** that you install this on a fresh installation of Ubuntu 22.04 LTS.
> It may work on older and newer version of Ubuntu as well, It's just not tested on those version.
